# 🎮 Online Gaming Site - OOP Module

This is a group project developed in **Java** during my **2nd year, 1st semester** at SLIIT. The project follows the **MVC architecture** and simulates an **Online Gaming Site**. I was responsible for implementing the **Game Management** part of the system.

## 🧩 Project Modules

The system includes the following key modules:

- 👤 **User Management** – Handles user registration, login, and profile management.
- 💳 **Payment Management** – Manages payment processing and purchase history.
- 🎮 **Game Management** – Allows admin to insert, update, delete and view game list, User can view game details and filter games.
- 💬 **Feedback Management** – Enables users to submit and view feedback for games.

## 👨‍💻 My Responsibilities

I developed the following core functionalities related to managing games:

- ✅ **Insert Game** – Add new games with name, genre, price, description, release date, multi player.
- ✏️ **Edit Game Details** – Update existing game information.
- ❌ **Delete Game** – Remove games from the system.
- 🔍 **View Game Details** – See detailed information about a specific game.
- 🎯 **Filter Games** – filter game by genre.

## 🧱 Technologies Used

- **Java** (Servlets and JSP)
- **MySQL** (Database)
- **JDBC** (Database Connectivity)
- **HTML/CSS** and **Bootstrap** (Front-end)
- **MVC Architecture**

## 🚀 How It Works

- Users can **add, edit, delete**, and **view** game information.
- Admins can manage all games.
- Filter features help users to find games quickly.
